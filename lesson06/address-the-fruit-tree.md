Produce the numeric and lark-notated equivalent addresses for each of the following nodes in the binary fruit tree:

grape: 9 -<+
banana: 11 ->+
watermelon: 12 +<-
green apple: 16 -<-<
lemon: 27 +<+>
orange*: 30 +>+<
peach: 42 ->->-
cherries*: 62 +>+>-
pineapple: 87 ->->+>

_note that the answers given for the orange and cherries [here](https://developers.urbit.org/guides/core/hoon-school/G-trees#exercise-address-the-fruit-tree) are incorrect. They mistakenly add 1 layer to the tree._
